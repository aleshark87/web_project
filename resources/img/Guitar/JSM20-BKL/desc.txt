The JSM20 is a hollow body electric guitar model introduced by Ibanez in 2018. It is a signature model for American jazz-rock guitarist John Scofield. It was initially made in China, but production moved to Indonesia in mid-2018.
The JSM20 features a thin, double cutaway, semi-hollow body design with a maple top with Æ’ holes and multi-layer binding and maple back and sides mated to a set-in sapele neck with a 22-fret ebony fingerboard with binding and aged white acrylic and abalone split block position markers. Components include dual Ibanez Super 58 humbucking pickups with gold covers and individual volume and tone controls and a tri-sound switch for the neck pickup, a Tune-o-matic style bridge with Quik Change III tailpiece, a bone nut and a black pickguard.
