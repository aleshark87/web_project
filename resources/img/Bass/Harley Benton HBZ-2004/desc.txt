The HBZ-2004 from the Harley Benton Deluxe series pairs a ovangkol neck-through body with a five-stripe neck made of maple, nato and mahogany loaded with a black, 24-fret walnut fretboard. The harmonious design and construction give you a sustain that goes on for days! Two ceramic pickups are fine-tuned using the active electronics for endless tonal possibilities, while the high-quality clear matte finish exudes a simple elegance that shouts “premium”!
