A pair of vintage-style, American-made Pure Vintage 64 Jazz Bass single-coil pickups provides classic, original-era Fender tone with clear articulation, clear low end definition, up-front midrange punch and singing high end. The vintage-accurate stacked concentric controls shape the pickups volume and tone, as well as allowing the pickups voice to be blended in any ratio to craft a unique sound. The vintage-style bridge sports four threaded steel barrel saddles, adding a touch of crispness that enhances the attack for tone that can power through a busy mix.
