The instruments of the Höfner Ignition Special Edition (SE) are based on the Höfner violin basses from the 1970s. In contrast to the Contemporary series, the Ignition basses have a hollow resonance body. In addition to the classic control panel with tea cup pots, they are equipped with a wooden bridge and trapezoid tailpiece and have the traditional Höfner logo on the body. The new Cavern variant (HI-CA-SE-SB) of our Ignition Bass offers the famous Pick Up Spacing from 1961 in addition to the features already mentioned. All of our Ignitions (SE) come with a certificate of authenticity and the legendary BASSMAN sticker.
