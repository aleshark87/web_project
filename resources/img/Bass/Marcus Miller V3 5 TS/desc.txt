The body of the V3 is crafted from Indonesian mahogany, known for its warm, clean and full-bodied sound. The neck is crafted from Canadian maple for a premium look and feel. A premium 3-band EQ preamp recently developed for this series to meet Marcus Miller's versatility needs and to cover various musical styles.
