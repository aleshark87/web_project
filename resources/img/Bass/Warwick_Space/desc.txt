The body, in its purple burst finish with matching tortoiseshell pickguard, is made of mahogany and has a screwed maple neck with Ekanga inserts, an exotic brown-colored wood already adopted by Warwick to reinforce the necks of its basses. The fingerboard is rosewood and has a 20-inch radius, for a flat, modern profile on all 24 frets interspersed with white star-shaped inlays. The scale measures 34 inches and culminates, on the body, in a two-piece Warwick bridge: saddles and open stoptail. The nut is a Just-A-Nut III, Warwick production adjustable in height without the need for files or invasive interventions.
