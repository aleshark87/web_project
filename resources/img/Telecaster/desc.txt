Fender Telecaster is a guitar with two single coil pickups controlled by a 3-position switch, a volume pot and a tone control. The body, in solid wood without a soundbox (solid body), completely cancels unwanted resonances and increases the sustain of the strings. The bridge is fixed, with the strings inserted under it. The neck, usually maple with a maple or rosewood fingerboard, is screwed to the body.

The Telecaster is a versatile guitar: it can go from the sounds of a steel guitar to the warm tones of a blues guitar, while maintaining its own, recognizable sound that sets it apart in every situation. Even today the simplicity of the instrument makes it a preference for many country, blues and rock musicians.
