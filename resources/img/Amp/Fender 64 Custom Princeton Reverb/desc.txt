The Fender Princeton needs no introduction. As guitar amplifiers go, it is widely regarded as the go-to choice of studio players and one of the best perfect compact combos for small gigs. 

Anyone who is anyone has played a Princeton at some time. It's got the pristine clean tones, the musical splash of spring reverb, the lush warble of tremolo... Even the proportions seem just right, with its 12-watts a manageable amount of power to deal with in a variety of situations. It takes pedals well, too. There is a lot to like.
